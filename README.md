# Trend Watch
**“Trend Watch”** is a PWA-enabled website for trending movies information and search movies in the movie database (TMDB) who owns the REST API used in this Front-end React PWA project. It can also be installed (add to home screen) as a standalone application on both desktop and mobile.<br />
This is a React frontend web project and backend REST API is provided by [The Movie Database](http://themoviedb.org).<br/>

## Configurations

Before you run this project, sign up and get your own `Access Token (v4 auth)` from [TMDB](http://themoviedb.org) to call their API. For convenience, create environment variable file named `.env` and paste the following like so:<br/><br/>
`REACT_APP_API_END_POINT=https://api.themoviedb.org/3`<br/>
`REACT_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TMDB_ACESS_TOKEN>`<br/>
`REACT_APP_POSTER_PATH=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500`<br/><br/>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
